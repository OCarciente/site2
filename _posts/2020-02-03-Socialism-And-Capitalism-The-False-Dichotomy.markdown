Socialism VS Capitalism: The False Dichotomy

Hi. How are you doing? How is your life? What do you do for a living?

Think about that for a moment. I would like to invite you to, for just a moment, think through a thought experiment with me.

Imagine that there's a society divided along the lines of screwdrivers and hammers.

----

I don't like democracy. Which is a weird way to start but also one I think you'll get as I keep talking. I don't like the ways in which things regress to the lowest common denominator. I don't like the idea of government being run by a popularity contest, especially in situations where voters exist who would think that person A is "more competent" or "better equipped" to do a certain job, but person B would be better "to have a beer with", who then vote for Person B. I don't think I should have a vote over whether or not

even though they will never actually have a beer with them. And they could have a beer with them as not-President or not-Prime Minister or whatever.

I think that in general, given the ways that most other systems of governance descend into despotic bullshit fairly quickly, and rely on a "good monarch" or a cohort of people who really believe some "great lie"/myth of the metals/etc (which... isn't a stable thing to rely on) that democracy is the best we have so far
and that's good

but... I also think we could do better.

And I think the way to do better is to have something closer to a technocracy. That is, a society governed by systems. Some of those systems might be democratic but some of them might be meritocratic (or something that approximates meritocracy in an unequal society) where people just... work their way up to positions. Where expertise is like... a real thing that is useful.

see: "agencies" like the EPA, etc, which (putting aside president-appointed people) generally have more of the population's trust and generally do their actual job instead of descending into weird nonsense
because their job is falsifiable.

Because their job doesn't rely on keeping volatile people who are subject to greater market forces and the whims of chance happy with what they see as "your performance", something that often relies on just lying about stuff because attributing things to your performance in the grand scheme of things is actually very hard.

Enter capitalism and socialism.

Capitalism, generally, is this system of capitalists owning the means of production, paying wages their workers (who do not own the means of production), then selling the products in question for some amount that costs more than their production, keeping the leftovers which are called "profits", and eventually using them to buy more means of production.
There's markets involved, and supply and demand, and so on.

Socialism, as either the "larval stage" of communism or as simply a scenario with a large powerful welfare state and good labour laws... isn't incompatible with that. Yes, in full communism the workers own the means of production, and "socialism" is a much more vague term, especially when discussing things with Americans who call anything to the left of Sauron "socialism".

But the basic ideas of AOC and Sanders and so on are basic ideas that are completely compatible with the ownership of the means of production by a class of moneyed elites.

The moneyed elites may have less money in some of those scenarios
but they continue to exist.

Through the lens of systems and technocracy and expertise and structures and so on... it becomes fairly obvious that saying you are a "capitalist" or a "socialist" doesn't really mean anything as a dichotomy, any more than saying you're "a football fan" or "a person who eats chips" means anything.

You can be both.

You can be neither

it's not a dichotomy, it's two separate things across two different axes

because capitalism in this frame is a system of PRODUCTION of goods.

and socialism is a system of DISTRIBUTION of goods.

And while they are related insofar as they are both attached to goods... you could have a system that is capitalist in its production and socialist in its distribution and that system wouldn't be internally contradictory.

this shows how generally... saying you are a capitalist is a little like saying you are a hammer-ist

and saying you are a socialist is a little like saying you are a screwdriver-ist

at some point... there's gonna be a nail and there's gonna be a screw

and being a hammerist for the screw or a screwdriverist for the nail is not going to actually work.

This doesn't actually "dismantle" the concept of ideology or something. But, to keep with the metaphor, some people are going to want something easily disassemblable and some people are going to want something harder to disassemble.
These are priorities people have. Perhaps, even, moral priorities, in some world of engineering. And many people IRL demand that we use screws instead of glue or nails when possible, in order to make things more assemblable and disassemblable.
It's perfectly reasonable to think that some of the rights involved in either system are "more important" than other rights. It's perfectly reasonable to think that a given tool (say, a hammer) is insufficiently useful for a given job.
But nobody would demand that everyone in the world become a screwdriverist.

If you imagine a world in which there are enormous ideological differences between those who use screwdrivers and those who use hammers, where people are self-declared screwdriverists or self-declared hammerists... who benefits?

The answer is kind of obvious: Screwdriver and hammer manufacturers looking to make people fight over something stupid through voting with their dollars (and in a world with opportunity cost, every vote involves someone's money).
Because... nobody actually cares (okay, I care, but I'm weird, and most of the people who care are weird) about the ways in which screws reduce the likelihood of damage to a piece of furniture over the course of its lifetime if it needs to be assembled and disassembled multiple times.

They care about being right about the fact that that's a thing. They care about being in the group that is right about that being a thing.

And they care about other people being wrong in order for their rightness to elevate them and those they associate with.

Because politics is the organization of the systems people live within, and therefore of the people themselves. And any political system that boils down to a popularity contest... presupposes there being an interest in making people behave in certain predictable ways. And the best way to turn an individual (who may have radically syncretic views when presented with the evidence) into part of a predictably-behaved cohort... is to give them an "identity". And "identities" based on beliefs can be very deeply held, because they cut to the core of you, the thing that you don't believe is an artifact of chance but instead an artifact of you having critical thinking skills and a greater understanding of the world than others.

"Social Democracy", in the form of Sweden, and Norway, and so on and so on,
