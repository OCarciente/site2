The Bill Gates Problem.

People have suggested that I rename this the [ceo of Nestle] problem, because Bill Gates is a kind soul who has done so many great things for the world, and so on and so on.

But... the fact that he's a kind soul and blah blah blah... is the point.

I am not talking about the problems you create by being greedy. I am talking about the potential adverse consequences of radically altering the global economic landscape.

So, here comes: The Bill Gates Problem:

Let us imagine that you are Bill Gates, in 1985....

Do you start microsoft?

You already know you're brilliant.
