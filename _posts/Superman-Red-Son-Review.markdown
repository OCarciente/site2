My review of Superman: Red Son.

Superman: Red Son is one of the most famous What If Superman comics out there. I was excited when I found out that it was getting an adaptation, and doubly so because it would be animated, and the DC animated team are the only people who know what the hell they're doing in DC, I swear.

The result was slight disappointment to me, which means it will blow most people's minds.

In the interest of spoiling just enough to make people want to watch or skip this movie, I will mention the things that it has that I did not expect, and which are not (as far as I remember) as overtly present in the original comic.

* Superman being asexual.
* Wonder Woman being a lesbian.
* Lois Lane Being Awesomely Feminist  
* Lane and Luthor actually kinda-sorta having a little bit of chemistry(?)

Here are things that I missed, which were in the comic but not in the film:

* Stalin's Son
* Russian Batman's Backstory
* Actually, Stalin's a lot of stuff. IIRC Batman doesn't just fucking murder the guy in the comic.
* The ending.

Honourable mentions go to Superman's Russian accent, Jimmy Olsen being black for no reason (again. What if Lois Lane was black for once, eh? They always raceflip the characters it would be least interesting to raceflip), and to Lex Luthor being the Worst Husband Ever. Seriously, it already makes no sense that Lois would go with an arrogant dickhead, but on top of that he's neglectful and disengaged? Like, come on. A girl has *needs*.

For anyone who thought "this ending is cute but trying to be too clever and is kind of BS"... Well, now it ends where the actual story ends.

For anyone who thought "WTF the end is the best part!"... It's okay, the comic still exists.
