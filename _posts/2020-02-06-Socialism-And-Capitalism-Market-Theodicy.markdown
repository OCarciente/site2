Socialism VS Capitalism 2: Market Theodicy.

There is a propensity for some older economists (though thankfully, the field has evolved, and many of these critiques have become obsolete in the past decade and a half), for what I will call "market theodicy". I don't think I'm the first person to come up with that term, as it's fairly intuitive and self-explanatory, but since I don't know who was, I will just use it without making allusion to any person who may have come up with it independently at an earlier date.

Market Theodicy is the practice of trying to solve "the problem of evil", where the god you are trying to absolve of sin is the market.
