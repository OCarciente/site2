Eager Question Reviews Fanfiction.

Review the First: Dudley's Memories.

Hello and welcome to Eager Question reviews fanfics. Why? Because tbh I find it kind of insane that I couldn't find anyone reviewing fanfiction who has my taste, so I figured I'd make it a thing and now I have a reason to write ~2K words a day on top of 132 works-in-progress (I have a problem with endings).

I now declare myself an Official Fanfiction Reviewer, and as such I will establish certain rules right off the bat, such that if I break them people will kindly call me the fuck out. And these rules are as follows:

1. Don't like, don't read.

I will not review anything I didn't like at least somewhat. Why? Because fanfiction is a labour of fucking love. I'm not being paid (at least, directly) by reviewing by the writers, or the websites, or anything of the sort. Nobody asked for my opinion. I'm volunteering it anyway, because I believe in the power of not-keeping-my-thoughts-inside-my-brain, but there is a line, and that line lays in the world of not-having-anything-good-to-say. If I ever write a review that is negative, or *only* negative... feel free to call me out on that, and I will either take it down or issue a formal retraction.

2. No personal attacks.

I don't care if the writer is literally Hitler. I don't care if the writer has plagiarized someone, or has done some terrible things IRL. I don't care if the writer was personally mean to *me*. If I don't want to signal-boost someone, I will just not write that review, and that's it. No insulting, no demeaning, no mocking, no dogpiling, no anything of the sort. This is a fanfiction reviewing subsection of a personal website, not a fucking court of law.

3. Judging things within their context.

I think that Snape/Lily is a weird and kind of gross ship. I think that Snape was basically a shitty incel whose obsessive behaviour hurt people, and who bullied already-traumatized children for no reason. And I also think Ananke (find link) is one of the best fanfics I've ever read, despite its baffling insanity, its main ship, and the general way in which it treats James Potter (who I think is out of character and unnecessarily cruel).

"This ship is conceptually bad" is not a good enough reason to judge or dismiss a specific fic. I will judge things in their own context, with their own priors, and for what they are aiming to do (though I may also note that I would have preferred if they were aiming to do something else).

4. While I am willing to review well-known fics, I will aim for lesser known ones.

Well-known fics already have a lot of attention, and in a world in which reviewers aren't actually glorified commentators, the point of reviewing is to bring attention to things that aren't getting a lot of attention. Therefore, while I may eventually get around to the Albus Potter Series or to Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, etc... I'm not in any rush to do so.

Okay? Okay.

So, as an Official Fanfiction Reviewer, I will begin with a shorter fic, which gives way to a much longer (and much more interesting) one. [Dudley's Memories](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories).

First, the spoiler-free version: I love this take on Dudley. Harry and Ginny and Hermione are all solidly in-character. The kids are well-written as kids, the adults are well-written as adults, and generally speaking the whole thing just works in a sufficiently canon-compliant way so as to not bother me. It's a good story. It's written well, and it touches on domestic violence really well.

Now, onto the spoilers.

Dudley's Memories is a fic with a fairly common premise: What if Dudley's daughter was a witch? How would he deal with it? How would she deal with it? What would happen to them? Would he grow as a person because of it, or follow in the footsteps of his father?

And then, it just kind of skips a lot of those steps. The Dudley we meet in the first few chapters is already a good person. He's kind, and patient, and he's *gay* and *married*, and on top of it all he's just... good. In a way that I never thought Dudley Dursley could ever be realistically written as being.

Shortly after the start of the story we learn that he's going by a different last name (Barton, his husband's), because he wants to distance himself from his family. Both of his parents have died by the time our tale begins, and... age didn't help them grow out of their situation. However, another notable feature of this is that he *wrote a book*. A book about Harry.

The notion of growing to understand the story of Harry Potter through the lens of Dudley Dursley is intriguing to me, and I really wish we'd gotten more excerpts from his book in the story. Dudley aimed to censor magic out of his memoir, changing Hogwarts for some other random school for "gifted" children, and anonymizing Harry as "the boy".

He works as some sort of social worker, and adopted one of his cases. Generally, I find the way that abuse is handled in the story very interesting. I like the idea that Dudley ate compulsively to try to assuage his guilt over doing nothing while Harry suffered. I like the notion that he exacerbated their abuse because he thought it would draw attention away from the fact that he was gay. It strikes me as a good exercise in emotional charity. "What if Dudley isn't an asshole, but just... a kid, with scary and bad authority figures, trying to protect himself?" is a very good question I don't think a lot of people ask.

Lastly, the framing device of Harry adopting an emotionally abused child, and the consequences that might have... is good. I like it.

All told, this fanfic is fantastic and I am very glad I wrote it.

Tune in next week, when I review the far larger, very interesting "Snape's Memories".
