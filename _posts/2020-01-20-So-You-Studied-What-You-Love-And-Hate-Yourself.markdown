I graduated from university with a Bachelor of Arts and Science, the art was Philosophy and the science was Psychology.

Yes, I knew that lots of people make fun of psychology for "not being a real science", and therefore most of my psychology degree was basically neuroscience and primatology, which are slightly harder to make fun of though, if I'm being honest, I switched from Neuro to Psych due to the rigor (neuroscience gets away with *so much bullshit*. We're talking sample sizes of *three* to establish "neurological differences between men and women" here. The amount of rigor in psychology as opposed to neuroscience is astonishing).

On January 22nd of the year 2020 (or REPUBLICAN CALENDAR DATE), I attended a university's career fair.

I don't think anything makes me angry and suicidal like career fairs do.

I once went to a "workshop" on learning how to make your resume better and how to make yourself more attractive to prospective employees, in which the people in question *literally said* that they wouldn't disclose how much they were willing to pay for a service before the person asked for a specific payment. The obvious motivation being: hoping that the prospective employee will undervalue their labour such that they don't have to pay them a fair wage.

I spent five years in university, because I hate myself and want to die often enough that it hindered the speed at which I completed my studies. I graduated with a double degree in Philosophy and Psychology, and as such I spent a solid four of those years hanging out semi-regularly with communists and proto-communists. There was not a single fucking thing they said that was more persuasive to me that we need to stab capitalism in the face, than spending one day (not even a full day! Six hours, tops!) in that employment workshop. Up until that point, I had always been "but employers", "but jobs", "but price mechanism". I wasn't happy with general neoliberal ideas by any means, I've always been more of a "what if Sweden, but everywhere and better?" kind of person. But capitalism seemed to me to be a neutral tool. Like "hammerism" or "screwdriverism". Not really an ideology so much as a system that can be useful in some situations and less useful in others.

And then I saw those people say that. And I started to think "you know what? Dr. Brown was right. He wasn't strawmanning the capitalists. They are just that shitty."

When you have a philosophy degree and are also unemployed, people are very prone to telling you "you should have gone into STEM, then". However, much of the value of STEM degrees is in their rarity. Programmers, for example, become a lot more expendable the moment they are more common per capita. I have a friend who chose a CS degree, and graduated the same year as I did. He is also unemployed, and if I had gotten a CS degree I would probably be in his position (except not really, because I have like six apps I would like to make, so at least I'd be doing that).

I was discussing this with my father, who declared that the city we live in "is weird. I mean, they complain about not having talent, but they want entry-level jobs with five years of experience".

It's not weird, I told him. It's late stage capitalism. It's capitalist fuckery.

But the thing is. You don't get paid by saying "this is capitalist fuckery".

So what do? You got a degree in underwater basket-weaving, the libertarians are being shits about it because a neoliberal dystopia we live within is determined to tell us that the value of our education rests on the resources we can exchange our labour for and not on the beauty and delight that education can offer for itself, how it may help you grow as a person, or even just... whether it was a good experience.

At which point they will respond with "well, can you pay rent with that experience?" and the answer is... no, my life is shit and I hate myself.

It's kind of astonishing to me that even though several countries in the world have managed to create systems in which people can study anything they want in university and not end up knee-to-elbow deep in debt, people still want to use the fact that a handful of rich countries haven't successfully done that as a reason to justify mocking those who followed the advice they were told to follow and studied, well, what they loved.
