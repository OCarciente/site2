Review the Second: Snape's Memories.

Spoiler-free version: This is a good take on Snape. I think that there are many writers who fall into glorifying Snape, or otherwise making him out to be not-a-huge-asshole. And while this fic does a fair bit of that (wtf was the deal with the Ginny thing?) it largely highlights the fact that, while Snape hated himself... he did so because he was kind of a piece of shit. And he was like that because he was alone and abused and so on.

That's not an excuse. But it is a reason.

All of the characters from the series are on point, and well written. The children feel like children, but not in an annoying way. Kreacher is surprisingly nice and to be honest, that is what I found least believable out of the whole fic. Themes of child abuse are handled tactfully, and the character development is slow and steady.

Onto the spoilers.

So, much of this fic hinges on a strange notion that I don't really understand. Did Snape get like... reincarnated? If so, shouldn't the kid be exactly as old as the day he died minus nine months?

If we put aside the metaphysics of the premise, I actually really like the dreams. I like the idea of Snape being a kind of guardian angel. I like the idea that he... got better, after dying. I like the idea of the Potters adopting an abused child, I think it jives well with their characters while also echoing some interesting themes. I like the way parental love is treated.

All in all, this is a very well-written fanfic. The worldbuilding and magic and history of the past seventeen or so years is done fantastically, and the characters feel as though they have grown into exactly who they would have become. A notable exception to that is Hermione, who in my view would be involved with something on a deeper level than Magical Child Services, in much the same way that while Hillary Clinton was interested in child welfare, she was much more involved in the legal scholarship of it than she was in any individual set of cases or with any individual branch of the government.

Hermione would, of course, be way cooler than Hillary Clinton, but you know what I mean. I don't really see Hermione getting her hands dirty after the failures of SPEW.

There are a lot of threads in this story, and I'm kind of amazed looking back on it by how thoroughly balanced the story feels given that. There's the matter of Snape's legacy, the adoption plot (which is subdivided into the legal plot and the emotional matter of him adapting to living with the Potters), the mystery of what the deal with the kids' family was, the metaphysical stuff, Harry dealing with the aftermath of his abuse and reconciling with Dudley... and that's all packed into what is otherwise a fairly short fic come to think of it.

There are a few strange stumbles (Ron feels kind of lacking,)
