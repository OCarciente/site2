"A responsibility to bear witness to the consequences of our actions"?

I spent the time from February in 2019 to February 2020 unemployed. Most of that time was spent slowly wasting away in bed while looking for reasons not to kill myself and struggling to find them. However, some of that time was spent going to "workshops", and learning how to make resumes, how to negotiate, how to look good for an interview, and so on and so forth. Putting aside that this should really be a social studies section in high school and it's kind of nonsensical bullshit that it's not (I mean, really, if everyone in school is going to be ignoring the lessons that history teaches them and voting for demagogues, then maybe at least teach them to make a resume?).

One of those workshops was a neat form of outsourcing, in which students attended a "lecture" about certain green energy sector problems, and brainstormed how to fix them, and then the people who would monetarily benefit from those solutions take them home and try them out, and the students get nothing but the experience of having kinda-sorta filled in a piece of paper.

But you know, it's *experience*, and that makes it okay!

Putting aside the normalization of the exploitation of students' intellectual labour, something about that workshop really pissed me off, and that was that one of the people in question told a room full of students that corporations aren't going to change their behaviour, so they need to jump through several layers more of bullshit than their parents did in order to get hired with more qualifications than their parents had.

On an individual level of reverse-engineering the idea that makes sense. If you are a single individual and you do not have access to the kind of people that make those decisions, then *surely* it will be more beneficial to focus on what you can control than on the greedy fuckers in C-suites making bullshit decisions that kill people in ways that are sufficiently indirect so as to not count as "really murder" regardless of the premeditation and motive. But this was a workshop. And there was a speaker. And that speaker, who had a PhD on this shit, had chosen to speak to students, to tell them to change their behaviour.

If he could call himself a persuasive speaker (and tbh I kind of don't know that he could), then this is a situation in which he could change the behaviours of people.
And... if he could change the behaviours of people, why change the behaviours of those who have the least money, and not those with the most money? Why change the behaviour of those who live within the systems and are being shoved into weird kinds of actions like the normalized unpaid labour that is "internships", and not the behaviour of the fuckers in the c-suites who can make those decisions?

And the answer is, because they don't want to. He doesn't want to.

Treating companies as if they were forces of nature absolves them of culpability.

If you can persuade a bunch of students to sell themselves into slavery, surely you can persuade a bunch of C-suite dickheads to not demand that of them, no? Is not the cost of selling yourself into slavery much greater than the cost of paying people 20K/year when you are a millionaire?

And the answer is, well, no, because cost here isn't being measured in dollars or in QALYs or in abstract utility, or even in incentives. Cost here is a function of bargaining power. It does not fucking matter if a billionaire would lose 0.0001% of his wealth by putting in some pocket money to pay the interns.  What matters is that when you are a billionaire and you say "I don't wanna," that carries vastly greater weight.

At one point over this period of time, someone very dear to me said something very strange. I told her that even a friend of mine who has a computer science degree struggled for months before getting a job, and that therefore it was not my (admittedly not lucrative) choice of double-major that was behind my unemployment. What was behind it was the buyer's market bullshit of "please come work for us at wages below the poverty line, person with a computer science degree and 40K in debt, because the alternative is just kind of dying". At which point, people like my friend, who have supportive parents they can leech off of, say "no, wtf?". Then this person told me that if you're unemployed, after a full year of applying to jobs, that's a "you" problem, and moreover that if you take a shitty job to make ends meet and then continue to remain in that job for a whole year, that is also a "you" problem. Because what you're supposed to do is take the shitty job, then spend the whole time you're employed working two jobs (one of them called "jobseeking"), and going to events, and networking, and so on and so forth, in order to get a non-shitty job within the year.

Think about that.

I can't think of a lot of scenarios where this is a sane argument. The only way for this to really make sense, in my opinion, is for you to think that a.) a good job is a necessary consequence of "doing things right" (it is fucking not), and b.) that the opportunity cost of having your soul sucked out by a shitty job doesn't exist. Otherwise, this is just kind of a weird bullshit argument that makes no sense, which is "propped up" by some next-level just-world-fallacy.

This is the kind of logic that Ben Shapiro uses, while he uses his law degree to not-practice-law, because telling marginalized people to suck it turned out to be vastly more lucrative. It's the ridiculous logic by which people say "follow your dreams" and "do what you love", and then when you do they tell you "you have just made a terrible mistake! Your dreams aren't sufficiently profitable for us to deem them worthy of paying you money. What if you do the work anyway, but for free, and then we get money?"

People who make fun of arts majors should be forced to live in a public domain bubble, which is >90 years in the US. No fonts from the last 90 years, no stories from the last 90 years, no TV shows, no films from the last 90 years, no books, no essays, no news. No images, no logos, no UX design.

Then, motherfucker, you can say how useless it is to major in the arts.

But putting aside my bitterness at the people who say they wish more people flooded the market with the skillsets they want, in the process reducing the average pay for that given skillset by increasing the supply... let's go back to that workshop.

In that workshop, a man stood in front of a lot of students, and told them that they needed to engage in entrepreneurial thinking in order to be able to succeed in the workplace.

Does anyone else find it fucking weird that in a society that has systematically destroyed mid-skill jobs by assembly-line-ing them into low-skill jobs, telling a bunch of kids who have or are about to have university degrees (which are supposed to shove them into high-skill jobs) that they have to have *even more skills* in order to succeed in the workplace...

I don't know, doesn't that seem kind of perverse?

It seems very perverse to me, because it uncritically accepts these incentives as "the case". These kids could be the CEOs of tomorrow, and they could be getting taught in that workshop that the ethics of having a successful business are such that you shouldn't pay people a shit wage. But they weren't being taught that. They were primed to think that if they develop a bajillion skills then they will get hired and rise to the top, at which point they will think that their path was the path that was "supposed" to happen and that anyone else having a path less-filled-with-suffering would be them getting off easy.
