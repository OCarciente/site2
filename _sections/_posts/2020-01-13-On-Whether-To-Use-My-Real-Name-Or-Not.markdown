I am agonizing over whether or not to write this under my own name.

On the one hand, there is the fear. What if I get doxxed?

On the other hand there is the knowledge that if somebody is particularly dedicated, it's not as though it would be difficult for them to find out. I mean, I write in a fairly idiosyncratic way, I am placing a lot of random information out there (from my first language to the gender I was assigned at birth, to my immigration status to my mental health problems).

Which leads to the greater question: What *is* anonymity?

In the early days of the internet, long long ago and millions of miles away, nobody knew if you were a dog.

That's a joke, but also it makes a point: Nobody knew if you were a womman, or a man pretending to be a woman, or a trans woman pretending to be a man, or a child or an old person, or anything at all. The jokes of "ah, the internet, where the men are men, the women are men, and the children are FBI agents" made sense in a world of extreme unverifiability.

It was like the old west, where, coincidentally, nobody knew if you were making up your name, because it was fairly easy to forge documentation.

This notion of unverifiability is at the heart of what anonymity really is.
