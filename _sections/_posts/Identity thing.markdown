Taken Seriously.

The Trans desire to be taken seriously.

Why is the trans community's push to redefine "woman" to mean "person who has this gender identity"?

note about alterous interaction: all married couples "should be" each other's best friends.
The idea that you need a new term for this presupposes the idea that it isn't covered by the preexisting terms.
and this is true of a lot of lgbt+ stuff.

The fact of the matter is that accepting allies see the categories as fuzzy, and therefore think the terms are kind of weird bullshit. But enemies see the categories as strict, and use the strictness of the categories to legitimize disregarding the experiences of people

...I'm starting to think that like... the obsession with depicting stories with archetypes instead of like, just people being people... and add to that the persistent shaming of anything other than certain ideals... it's just a weird shitty form of epistemic injustice being done to people in England and its Rich Former Colonies)

and that the persistent phenomenon of creating new labels for ever-more-small distinctions is the only way people in that environment have to make sense of their world in which they are not one of like, five or six acceptable things or something)

you gotta have a 5-man band
you gotta have a love interest
you gotta blah blah blah
lots of stories are poorly written not because the words or the grammar or even the plot are bad, but because there are single-function characters there that never get developed
and they never get developed because their "purpose" is to check a box

(And I mean subdividing things into smaller and smaller and more edge case categories is the first step to like... breaking free of that expectation.)
(Its partially people trying to make sense of themselves but it's also partially just like... formally acknowledging that this can exist)


(I proposed that as a model with like, 72 genders giving way to gender abolitionism)
(but also, the thing is the idea that before it wasn't formally acknowledged)
(like, remember how people were like "amatonormativity be like that" in the toafn chat at some point, and I was like "Venezuela is amatonormativist AF and I never ever ever felt any of these things you're talking about"?)
(I think that's because in Rich British Colonies, like... the concepts are just depicted as stricter)
(the idea that you can love someone with all your heart... in a non-sexual non-romantic way... is just part of friendship)
(lots of close friendships exist)
(But if you define friendship more strictly then you need a NEW THING that regards that form of emotional intimacy)
(and if every time that like, close friends are depicted in media, they're always no-homoing each other)
(and/or they're being seen as secretly love interests)
(like, it becomes clear that the concept of friendship in that environment doesn't envelop that kind of emotional closeness)

(Yeah. I mean, I think the labels exist because that's what words are for. I think the fact that people are so DEFENSIVE about them and guard them so carefully is because of this.)
(And why how-you-connect-with-people is like, a defining part of peoples identities)

NOTE: Identity as Allegiance vs Identity as Self

(like, the french-revolutionary concept of fraternit√© is basically that. Being very very close to people who aren't romantic partners and calling them family and so on)

(and that has nothing to do with modern "queer discourse")

(Yeah)

(Every time people say "this has existed forever, we're just putting language to it now"... Iunno it does a weird thing in my brain)
(because it's like... yeah, there are a lot of historical examples of the thing, very often. But... they didn't need a word then, so why is there a need for the word now?)
(and sometimes the reason is like, metatagging)
(If most of your interactions with people like that occur because you google the same things, it makes sense to just create a new word in order to find each other online)
(and sometimes it seems like the reason is pride-related. Like, it's not just finding one another it's calling attention to the group as a cohort that is "a way to be" in terms that make it "more legitimate")
(but that only works under the assumption that it wasn't legitimate before)
(and that only works because like... the pre-existing language and the pre-existing interactions are so frequently so weirdly strict)

because it frustrates me so much when people use more and more terms and more and more words and it feels like... just have close female friends and think they're pretty? Why call yourself an aroace lesbian? But what's happening isn't like, "I am using these words to describe an individualistic behaviour or an experience", it's "I'm using these words as a form of allegiance-declaration and community-participation"

and that's just... not how I use language because for the most part other people get to decide if I'm in their ingroup or not, and for the most part they decide "not"

there's nothing wrong with terminology. There's something frustrating about like, creating a moral issue about the thorough assimilation of terminology by a person and dismissing them if their linguistic adaptation is insufficiently quick or effective by one's standards even though they mean no harm and do not actively like... engage in any action that has negative harmful consequences in terms of material conditions
